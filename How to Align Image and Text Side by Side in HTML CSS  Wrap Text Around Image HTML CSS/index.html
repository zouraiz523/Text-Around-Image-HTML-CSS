        <p>
            One of the common tasks that web developers face is how to put image and text
            side-by-side in HTML without them overlapping each other. In most cases,
             you can simply paste the image or video into your document and type out the text around it.
          However, if the text or image is too long for the space you have available
           on the page, you may have to redesign your layout or position the image
            elsewhere on your page.n, the pains of the corrupt, the chosen or the thing
           this pain is softened.
